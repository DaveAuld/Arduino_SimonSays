# Arduino_SimonSays
An implementation of the classic memory game using Arduino


I had initially wrote this as an article way back in 2009 on CodeProject and the code etc. was hosted on there.
https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/43325/Arduino-Platform-SIMON-Game-Implementation

I decided to upload the code to here seeing as I have the account and might as well make use of it! You never know I might come back and update it further one day.

Any way....all yours!

Cheers,
Dave
